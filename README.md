# Hiding-the-Text-Behind-the-Object
Adobe Photoshop allows you to easily hide text behind an object. To do this, select the object you wish to hide text behind, then use the “Layer Mask” feature to mask out the area of the object that the text should appear behind. You can also adjust the transparency of the layer mask to make the text more or less visible.
